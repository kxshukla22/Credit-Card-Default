# Credit-Card-Default
# Summary
Machine learning models can be an important feature to predict the credit card default for the customers for the next payment.
These methods can bolster the risk management toolkits for credit card companies. 
In this project, I have used two gradient boosting algorithm - XGBoost and LightGBM. 
It compares the AUC(area under curve) score of XGBoost and LightGBM model to see which model predicts the higher probability of default for the customers. 
I trained and tested the gradient boosting model on the dataset of credit card holders that is retrieved from University of California, Machine Learning Repository. 
I found that the predictive power of LightGBM outperformed that of XGBoost model. LightGBM achieved an auc of 0.785, whereas XGBoost model achieved an auc of 0.781. 
This means that prediction of LightGBM model has higher probability to show the default of credit of the customers.
